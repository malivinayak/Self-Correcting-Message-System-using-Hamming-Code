<h1 align="center"> Self Correcting Message System<br>using Hamming Code </h1>

## Abstract
This paper presents, how to send a self-correcting
message with the help of hamming code. Hamming code is
an error detection and correction technique. Message bits
are received in signal form and then check if there any bits
get flipped due to noise and if is so then message get
corrected by itself. Self-correcting message applies its 5
extended parity bits to check for each 11-bit data. If one bit
get flipped, then that error bit is identified and corrected by
this system, and if 2 bits get flipped then machine is able to
detect that 2 errors are present. This system can be also used
in Compact Disc (CD) and Digital Versatile Disc (DVD)
